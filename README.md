A simple game based off the show Dragon Ball Z. The board state is comprised of four different squares, where each square is occupied by either your player's character or the 
enemy AI. The game then goes as follows:

1. The players decide which square to move to.
2. The players choose a skill to use and which square to target with the skill.
3. In a situation where both players decide to move onto the same square, a brawl occurs and the loser is knocked onto a random square.
4. The first player to reach 0 hp loses, and if both players hit 0 hp at the same time it ends in a draw.
